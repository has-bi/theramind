# Musical Instrument

## Brief

Not everyone has the luxury of owning a musical instrument, but maybe those people have a laptop, phone, or tablet. Having a piano is a powerful way to let people play music even if they didn’t have the opportunity before.

## Level 1

Using the browser and web audio APIs, we can create sounds that when put together, can actually sound like music.

Create a set of buttons that play notes of a scale when clicked.

## Level 2

While not everyone’s played an instrument before, the concept and interface of an instrument like a piano is generally more intuitive than a bunch of buttons.

Create a piano layout using buttons that works by either clicking the button or using the physical keyboard.

## Level 3

We might have limited space in the browser, but there’s a wide range of notes, scales, and sounds an electric keyboard might be able to make with some added effects.
