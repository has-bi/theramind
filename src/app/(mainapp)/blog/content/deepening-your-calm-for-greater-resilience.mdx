## Honoring Your State of Calm

If you're experiencing a sense of calm right now, take a moment to recognize this valuable emotional state. Calmness—that feeling of tranquility, ease, and balance—is not just pleasant but deeply beneficial for your mind and body. In our often hectic and overstimulated world, moments of genuine calm deserve to be acknowledged and appreciated.

This feeling of calm you're experiencing isn't just the absence of stress or worry—it's a positive state with its own distinct qualities. Perhaps you notice a sense of clarity in your thinking, ease in your body, or a feeling of being grounded and present. Whatever calmness feels like for you right now, it's worth pausing to fully experience it.

## Understanding Calmness

From a physiological perspective, calmness is associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system—often called the "rest and digest" mode. When you're calm, your heart rate and blood pressure tend to lower, your breathing deepens, and your muscles relax. Your body shifts resources toward regeneration, healing, and optimal functioning of your immune and digestive systems.

Mentally, calmness creates space for clearer thinking, better decision-making, and enhanced creativity. It allows you to respond thoughtfully to situations rather than react automatically. Research shows that regular experiences of calm can improve concentration, memory, and cognitive flexibility.

Emotionally, calmness serves as a foundation for resilience. It helps create a stable base from which you can experience the full range of emotions without becoming overwhelmed. Like a deep, still pool that can absorb ripples without being fundamentally disturbed, cultivated calmness allows you to remain centered even amid life's inevitable challenges.

## Practical Strategies to Deepen and Extend Your Calm

When you're already feeling calm, you have an excellent opportunity to strengthen this state and make it more accessible in the future. Here are evidence-based approaches to work with your current calmness:

### 1. Anchor Your Awareness in Calm

Take time to fully experience and remember this feeling of calmness, creating a strong mental reference point:

- Notice where in your body you feel calm most distinctly. Is it a sense of relaxation in your shoulders? Easiness in your breath? Openness in your chest?

- Register the thought patterns that accompany calmness. You might notice fewer racing thoughts, more space between thoughts, or a different quality to your thinking.

- Create a mental bookmark of this state that you can return to later. Some people find it helpful to silently name the feeling: "This is calmness."

### 2. Extend Calm Through Mindful Awareness

Mindfulness—the practice of present-moment awareness without judgment—pairs naturally with calmness:

- Take a few minutes to simply be with your breath, following its natural rhythm without trying to change it. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.

- Try a brief body scan, bringing attention systematically from your feet to your head, noticing sensations with curiosity and without trying to change them.

- Practice mindful engagement with a simple activity like drinking tea, washing dishes, or walking, bringing full attention to the sensory experience.

Research shows that regular mindfulness practice can help make calmness more accessible even during stressful times.

### 3. Create Environmental Support for Calm

Your physical environment can either support or undermine your sense of calm:

- Reduce unnecessary stimulation by turning off notifications, creating periods of digital silence, or designating certain spaces as technology-free.

- Incorporate elements that support calm, such as natural materials, plants, adequate lighting, or meaningful objects that evoke positive feelings.

- Consider how sound affects your state—whether that means introducing gentle music, nature sounds, or creating periods of comfortable silence.

### 4. Develop Regular Practices That Cultivate Calm

Use your current calm state as motivation to establish or strengthen practices that build your "calm capacity":

- **Breathing practices**: Simple techniques like extended exhales (breathing out longer than you breathe in) or gentle abdominal breathing can quickly signal safety to your nervous system.

- **Movement practices**: Activities like yoga, tai chi, qigong, or even mindful walking can help integrate calmness into your physical experience.

- **Creative practices**: Engaging in creative activities without pressure for particular outcomes—drawing, playing music, gardening, cooking—can maintain and deepen calm states.

### 5. Nurture Calm in Relationships

Our emotional states are profoundly influenced by our social connections:

- Spend time with people who help you feel calm and grounded rather than anxious or depleted.

- Practice calm communication—speaking from a centered place, listening fully, and allowing pauses rather than rushing to fill silence.

- Set and maintain boundaries that protect your sense of calm, whether that means limiting time with certain people or being clear about your needs.

## When Calm Feels Elusive

Even with the best practices, there will be times when calmness seems difficult to access:

- Remember that all emotional states are temporary and that your capacity for calm remains even when you're not feeling it in the moment.

- During stressful periods, simplify your calming practices rather than abandoning them. Even thirty seconds of mindful breathing can make a difference.

- Be particularly gentle with yourself when calm is hard to find, treating yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend.

- If persistent anxiety, agitation, or emotional dysregulation is interfering with your wellbeing, consider speaking with a mental health professional who can offer targeted support.

## Calm as a Practice, Not a Destination

The most balanced people don't simply avoid stress—they develop the ability to return to calm more quickly after disruption. They understand that calmness isn't about controlling external circumstances but about cultivating internal resources that allow for resilience amid change.

Your current experience of calm isn't just a pleasant accident—it's both an achievement and an opportunity. By acknowledging it, understanding it, and working skillfully with it, you can develop a deeper relationship with calmness that serves you in all areas of life.

As you move forward from this moment, carry the quality of calm with you. Let it inform how you engage with tasks, how you connect with others, and how you meet challenges. And remember that each time you notice, appreciate, and nurture your calm, you strengthen this essential capacity for the future.

## Try These Calm-Deepening Practices

- **Calm body scan**: Find a comfortable position and bring awareness to different parts of your body, starting from your feet and moving upward. For each area, silently say, "I notice calm in my [body part]" or "I invite calm into my [body part]," allowing a few breaths before moving on.

- **Five senses grounding**: When you're feeling calm, use all five senses to fully experience the present moment. Notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This creates a rich, multisensory memory of calmness.

- **Calm moves with you**: For one day, set an hourly reminder to check in with your sense of calm. Notice if it's present, and if so, how it feels in that moment. If it's faded, take three conscious breaths to reconnect with the feeling. This builds awareness of how calm fluctuates and how you can influence it.
