## Embracing Your Excitement

If you're feeling excited right now—that bubbly, energized, anticipatory feeling—take a moment to fully acknowledge this vibrant emotional state. Excitement is a wonderful emotion that fills us with energy, possibility, and forward momentum. It's worth pausing to appreciate this feeling rather than rushing past it.

Excitement can arise from many sources: anticipating something positive, starting a new project, connecting with someone special, discovering a new interest, or simply waking up feeling particularly alive and engaged with the world. However your excitement has emerged, it's offering you a valuable resource of energy and positivity.

## Understanding Excitement

From a physiological perspective, excitement shares some features with anxiety—increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and a surge of energy. The key difference lies in how we interpret and experience these sensations. While anxiety focuses on potential threats, excitement orients us toward positive possibilities.

When you're excited, your brain releases neurotransmitters like dopamine and adrenaline. These chemicals create that characteristic feeling of eagerness and energy. Your attention naturally narrows to focus on whatever has sparked your excitement, and your motivation to engage increases.

Excitement serves important functions in our lives. It helps us approach new opportunities, strengthens our capacity for engagement and learning, and builds anticipation that enhances eventual experiences. It can also be contagious, spreading positive energy to those around us.

Understanding the nature of excitement can help you work with it more effectively—harnessing its energy while also creating balance that prevents burnout or impulsivity.

## Practical Strategies for Working With Excitement

When excitement arises, it brings a surge of energy that can be channeled in different ways. Here are evidence-based approaches to make the most of this emotional state:

### 1. Savor the Experience

Before rushing to action, take time to fully experience and appreciate your excitement:

- **Notice the physical sensations**: Where do you feel excitement in your body? Perhaps as a fluttering in your chest, lightness in your limbs, or a pleasant warmth? Taking a moment to register these sensations helps encode positive emotional experiences more deeply.

- **Identify what has sparked your excitement**: What specifically are you excited about? Is it an outcome, a process, a connection, a possibility? Being clear about the source helps you channel the feeling more effectively.

- **Express your excitement**: Share your feeling with someone supportive, write about it, or simply acknowledge it aloud. Expressing excitement often amplifies it in a positive way.

### 2. Channel the Energy Productively

Excitement provides motivational fuel that can be directed purposefully:

- **Harness the creative potential**: Excited states often enhance creativity and ideation. Consider capturing ideas in writing, making plans, or engaging in brainstorming while in this energized state.

- **Take action on priorities**: Use your excitement as momentum for tasks that might normally require more effort. What important project could benefit from your current energy?

- **Create structure for your enthusiasm**: While it might be tempting to rush in all directions, creating a focused plan helps channel excitement productively. What specific steps would make the most of this energy?

### 3. Find Healthy Balance

Excitement, while positive, can sometimes become overwhelming or lead to imbalance:

- **Ground through your body**: If excitement feels too intense, try physical grounding practices like feeling your feet on the floor, taking deeper breaths, or engaging in rhythmic movement like walking.

- **Balance excitement with reflection**: Pair your enthusiasm with thoughtful consideration. Ask yourself questions like: "What's really important here?" "What potential challenges should I consider?" "How does this align with my broader goals?"

- **Pace yourself for sustainability**: Excitement provides a burst of energy, but pushing too hard can lead to eventual crash. Include periods of rest and recovery alongside action.

### 4. Connect With Others Authentically

Excitement naturally draws us toward sharing and connection:

- **Share your enthusiasm with discernment**: Choose receptive people who are likely to appreciate or share your excitement rather than dampen it. Not everyone will match your energy, and that's okay.

- **Listen as well as express**: While sharing your excitement, remain attentive to others. Mutual enthusiasm creates the strongest connections, while one-sided excitement can sometimes overwhelm.

- **Channel excitement into genuine curiosity**: Let your positive energy fuel interest in others' perspectives and experiences. Excitement can enhance our capacity for engaged listening when directed outward.

### 5. Create Meaningful Momentum

Use excited energy to create positive ongoing movement:

- **Set clear intentions**: What would you like to create or experience through this excited energy? Setting specific intentions helps direct enthusiasm toward meaningful outcomes.

- **Establish supportive routines**: Consider what structures or habits might help sustain the positive momentum beyond the initial excitement. How might you continue engagement when the initial surge fades?

- **Document your inspired thoughts**: Excitement often brings insights and possibilities that can serve you later. Capture these through writing, voice notes, or other methods before they fade.

## When Excitement Presents Challenges

While excitement is generally positive, certain patterns might warrant attention:

- If excitement regularly leads to impulsive decisions you later regret
- If you find yourself constantly seeking excitement at the expense of other important life dimensions
- If shifts between excitement and disappointment create significant emotional volatility
- If excitement frequently turns into anxiety or overwhelm

In these cases, working with a mental health professional can help develop strategies for emotional regulation while still allowing for healthy enthusiasm.

## The Wisdom in Excitement

Our culture sometimes undervalues excitement, particularly in adults. We may be encouraged to appear calm, collected, and "professional" rather than openly enthusiastic. Yet excitement carries important wisdom:

It connects us with our intrinsic motivations and what naturally energizes us.

It heightens our capacity for presence and engagement with the moment.

It reminds us of possibility and potential for positive change or experience.

It increases our resilience by building positive emotional resources.

By honoring your excitement rather than dampening it, you access this wisdom while adding vitality to your life and those around you.

## A Balanced Perspective

Remember that excitement, like all emotional states, naturally fluctuates. The goal isn't to maintain constant excitement—that would be both impossible and exhausting. Rather, it's about fully experiencing and channeling this emotion when it arises, while developing the capacity to transition gracefully when it naturally subsides.

Your current excitement offers valuable energy and information. By acknowledging it, understanding it, and working skillfully with it, you can harness its potential while maintaining balance and perspective.

As you move forward from this moment, carry the quality of excitement with you in a sustainable way. Let it inform how you engage with tasks, how you connect with others, and how you approach challenges. And remember that each time you fully experience positive emotions like excitement, you strengthen your capacity for wellbeing and resilience.

## Try These Excitement-Channeling Practices

- **Excitement mapping**: Take 10 minutes to create a visual map of your excitement. In the center, write or draw what you're excited about. Around it, branch out with specific aspects that energize you, potential actions to take, people to involve, and how this connects to your broader goals or values.

- **Balanced enthusiasm practice**: When feeling excited, try this four-part process: (1) Take three deep breaths to center yourself; (2) Mentally list three specific things you're excited about; (3) Consider one potential challenge or consideration to keep in mind; (4) Identify one clear next step to channel your energy.

- **Energy allocation exercise**: Imagine your excitement as a limited resource of energy—say, 100 units. How would you ideally distribute this energy across different areas or activities? Assign specific numbers to each area, ensuring they total 100. This helps you prioritize and create balance while still honoring your enthusiasm.
