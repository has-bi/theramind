Let me guess—you're tired. Not just "I stayed up too late" tired, but the kind of tired that follows you from morning bell to after-school practice to homework time, like some annoying shadow you can't shake. The kind where even your favorite things feel like work sometimes.

I get it. I've been there too.

## What's Really Happening When You're Always Exhausted

First off, your tiredness is real. It's not laziness, it's not "just being a teenager," and it's definitely not all in your head.

The truth? Your body and brain are working overtime right now. During adolescence, your brain is rewiring itself in major ways (literally—you're forming and pruning neural connections at a wild pace). Your body is changing shape, developing new systems, and possibly growing several inches in a short time. That alone would make anyone tired.

Then add in early school start times that fight your natural sleep cycle, the pressure to excel academically, maintain a social life, participate in activities, plan your future, and navigate complex emotions... all while your phone pings with notifications every few minutes. No wonder you're wiped out.

> Your tiredness isn't weakness—it's your body sending an important message that deserves attention.

## Breaking the Exhaustion Cycle

The good news? You can feel better, even with all the demands on your time and energy. Here are some approaches that actually work (and no, they're not just "go to bed earlier"):

### 1. Work With Your Brain's Natural Timing

Your brain's sleep-wake cycle has literally shifted during adolescence—it's biological, not laziness. Most teens naturally want to stay up later and sleep later. While you might not be able to change school start times, you can:

- Use bright light to your advantage. Get outside first thing in the morning for 10-15 minutes. The natural light helps reset your body clock.
- Create a "wind-down runway" before bed—dim the lights, silence notifications, and find a chill activity (reading, gentle stretching, even just staring at the ceiling and breathing) for 20-30 minutes before sleep.
- Keep sleep timing consistent, even on weekends. Sleeping in until noon on Saturdays then trying to fall asleep at 10 PM Sunday creates "social jet lag" that makes Monday mornings brutal.

Try this quick sleep hack: If racing thoughts keep you awake, keep a notebook by your bed. When your mind starts spinning with worries or tomorrow's to-do list, write it all down. This tells your brain "I've got this handled" so you can actually rest.

### 2. Feed Your Energy Systems

What and when you eat can either boost your energy or tank it:

- Never skip breakfast, even if you're not hungry. Your brain needs fuel after the overnight fast.
- Avoid the sugar trap—those energy drinks, frappuccinos, and candy bars give you a quick hit followed by an even bigger crash.
- Stay hydrated all day. Even mild dehydration can make you feel significantly more tired and irritable.

A day of energy-supporting meals might look like:

- Breakfast: Overnight oats with peanut butter and banana
- Lunch: Wrap with turkey, avocado, veggies and a side of fruit
- Afternoon snack: Greek yogurt with berries or a handful of trail mix
- Dinner: Whatever your family makes, but try to include protein, veggies, and complex carbs

### 3. Manage the Energy Vampires in Your Life

Sometimes, the biggest drain isn't school or activities—it's subtle things stealing your energy without you noticing:

- Screen time that keeps you in a state of low-grade stress or comparison
- Toxic friendships where you give more than you receive
- The pressure to appear "fine" when you're struggling
- Saying yes to commitments you don't actually care about

One student I worked with discovered that 20 minutes of scrolling before bed left her feeling more tired in the morning than if she'd stayed up an extra hour watching a movie she actually enjoyed. Pay attention to how different activities and people make you feel.

Try this challenge: Pick one day this week for a social media fast. Notice how your energy levels compare to regular days. No judgment either way—just information about what works for your body.

### 4. Move Your Body (Even When It's the Last Thing You Want to Do)

I know, when you're exhausted, exercise sounds horrible. But here's the weird truth—the right kind of movement can actually create energy rather than drain it.

- A 10-minute walk outside can be more energizing than a 20-minute nap
- Gentle stretching or yoga can activate energy systems when you're dragging
- Even dancing around your room to one song can shift your state

The key is finding movement that feels good to you, not what someone else thinks you should do. Movement shouldn't always feel like punishment or obligation.

### 5. Create Small Recovery Pockets

You might not be able to get a full eight hours of sleep or take a mental health day whenever you need one. But you can create micro-recovery moments throughout your day:

- Take three deep breaths between classes
- Step outside for fresh air during lunch
- Set a timer for a 5-minute break for every 25 minutes of homework
- Practice the 4-7-8 breath (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8) when you feel your energy crashing

## When to Get Extra Support

While tiredness is common, certain kinds of exhaustion deserve professional attention. Talk to a trusted adult about connecting with a healthcare provider if:

- You're getting adequate sleep but still feel constantly exhausted
- You've noticed other symptoms alongside tiredness (like feeling sad most days, unexplained pain, dramatic weight changes)
- Your fatigue has suddenly worsened for no apparent reason
- You feel tired in a way that seems different from your friends' experiences

These could signal underlying issues like anemia, thyroid problems, depression, or other treatable conditions.

## Remember This Truth

In a world that often treats productivity as the ultimate value, it takes courage to honor your body's need for rest and recovery. Your worth isn't determined by how much you accomplish or how many hours you can function without a break.

You're navigating a challenging time of life during a complex historical moment. Be as gentle with yourself as you would be with your best friend. Your energy will naturally rise and fall—that's not failure, it's being human.

The most important relationship you'll ever have is with yourself. Learning to listen to your body's signals now, including tiredness, is building a skill that will serve you for decades to come.
